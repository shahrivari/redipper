# Redipper
Redipper is a simple redis wrapper for Lettuce which makes it easier to use. The core features are:

* Definition of spaces over redis which gives a table-like feel over db.
* Generic collection API like Redisson.
* Automatic serialization of objects.
* Various encoders for compression and encryption.

Most of this code is written by [Mohammad Hossein Liaghat](https://github.com/MoHoLiaghat) and
